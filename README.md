# vagrant_wordpress

Stupid simple Vagrant setup for WordPress projects.

1) Move these files into the root of your WordPress project.

2) Name your project in the "project_name" variable in the Vagrantfile. 

3) Run `vagrant up` and give it a couple minutes to set everything up.

You'll be able to access your project from http://localhost:3000.
